# Create dictionary structure that can be saved as a .geojson map file with scalable markers

The structure is printed to create a .geojson file. The .geojson file is used to display maps with scalable markers such as this one [countries_map.geojson](https://github.com/marchhombre/Solving-issues/blob/master/Create%20geojson%20files%20for%20map%20display/countries_map.geojson) and this one [cities_map.geojson](https://github.com/marchhombre/Solving-issues/blob/master/Create%20geojson%20files%20for%20map%20display/cities_map.geojson). 

The function is found here [GeoJSONdict_function.py](https://github.com/marchhombre/Solving-issues/blob/master/Create%20geojson%20files%20for%20map%20display/GeoJSONdict_function.py) and the complete explanation is here
